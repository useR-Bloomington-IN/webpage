We are the local R User Group for Bloomington Indiana.

This group was founded in February 2018, with the goal of bringing together `R` users of all skill levels, in a welcoming, low pressure environment.
We welcome users from all backgrounds, whether they come from industry, academia, or somewhere else.

In order to make the opportunity to speak available to everyone, we try to have two presentations each month: A *short* presentation, usually discussing a package that a user has been enjoying, and then a longer *main* presentation, which can vary in scope and depth.
We also try to make time available for discussing recent lessons in R, and tips and tricks that we have picked up recently.

Our tentative meeting schedule is the *last Thursday of each Month*, although this may change in the future.
